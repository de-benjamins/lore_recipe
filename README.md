# lore_recipe
my first HTML Repo
prior to this point, i learned html on a website with easy to use coding environment. but from now on, i will be using git repositories to write my html files.

this project is a Recipe Webpage. i would be demonstrating my skills on the use of elements, tags, links, and attributes to structure the outlook of a webpage. and i will be doing all of that development from my local files.
