    <h2>Description</h2>
    I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients.
    So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, 
    and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. 
    Serve immediately over rice.
